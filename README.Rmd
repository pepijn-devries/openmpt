A [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/) port for `R`. It reads, plays and converts
[Open ModPlug](https://openmpt.org) Tracker music.
It supports a wide range of music [file formats](https://wiki.openmpt.org/Manual:_Module_formats).

## Installation

Install latest developmental version from R-Universe:

``` r
install.packages("openmpt", repos = c('https://pepijn-devries.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

On Debian/Ubuntu you need to install the developer version of libopenmpt and portaudio first:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libopenmpt-dev portaudio19-dev
```

And on Fedora you need:

```sh
sudo dnf install libopenmpt-devel portaudio-devel
```

On RHEL/CentOS/RockyLinux you first need to enable EPEL:


```sh
yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install libopenmpt-dev portaudio19-dev
```

## Example

You only need 3 lines of code to load the library, read a module and play it:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(openmpt)

mod <- read_mod(system.file("cyberrid", "cyberrid.mod", package = "openmpt"))

play(mod)
```
